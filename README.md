# ai_shopper_docker_compose
This docker-compose directory is for tracking/version control purposes only.

To use the docker-compose configuration:
1. Copy or move the `docker-compose.yml` file to the root directory that contains all projects
2. Run docker-compose commands from that root directory

The docker-compose file needs to be at the root level to properly resolve the relative paths and contexts for building the services.
