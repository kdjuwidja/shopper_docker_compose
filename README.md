# ai_shopper_docker_compose
This docker-compose directory is for tracking/version control purposes only.

To use the docker-compose configuration:
1. Copy or move the `docker-compose.yml` file to the root directory that contains all projects
2. Run docker-compose commands from that root directory

The docker-compose file needs to be at the root level to properly resolve the relative paths and contexts for building the services.

Code bases that you will need:
- [auth] (https://github.com/kdjuwidja/auth)
- [core] (https://github.com/kdjuwidja/ai_shopper_core)
- [service] (https://github.com/kdjuwidja/ai_shopper_service)
- [webapp] (https://github.com/kdjuwidja/ai_shopper_webapp)
